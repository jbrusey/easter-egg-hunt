#+title: Easter Egg Hunt

* Introduction

This is the way we run easter egg hunts in my family.
There is code - but it is not a web-site.
Instead, the code produces LaTeX output that can be printed and the prints are then cut up, stuck to individual eggs, and the eggs deposited in some location in the house.
